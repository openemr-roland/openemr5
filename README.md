# openemr5014vets

This will be the repository for a customized version of openemr for veterinary clinics. Code Uploads will start after Openemr 5.01 has been released and our customized code parts have been thoroughly tested with the latest release.

Most important changes:
- Adapted Patient Summary, Demographic and History screen.
- Changes to Globals 
- Customized lists
- Veterinary Code system how to
- New veterinary encounter and Clinical exam forms

Feel free to send me a message about what, when, what ifs and other questions.

Thanks
